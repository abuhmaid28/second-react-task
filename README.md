Overview of the Movie Website Project:

Project Description:
The Movie Website is a web application built using React that allows users to explore and search for movies. It leverages various technologies, including HTML, SCSS, React, React Router DOM, React Bootstrap, React Framer Motion, Axios API, npm, and Firebase for deployment.

Features:

Movie List: The website displays a list of movies fetched from a third-party API using Axios. Each movie card shows the movie poster, title, release date, vote count, and average rating.

Movie Details: Clicking on a movie card navigates the user to a detailed view of the movie. The movie details include a larger movie poster, title, release date, vote count, and average rating. Additionally, it shows a brief overview of the movie's plot.

Search Functionality: The website provides a search bar that allows users to search for movies based on keywords. The search triggers an API call to fetch relevant movies based on the entered query.

Pagination: To handle a large number of movies, the website implements pagination using the React Paginate library. Users can navigate through different pages of movie results.

Styling: The website's design and layout are customized using SCSS to provide an appealing user interface.

Animations: React Framer Motion library is used to add smooth animations to the movie cards and other elements, enhancing the user experience.

Deployment:
The website is deployed using Firebase hosting, allowing it to be accessible online and easily shareable with others.

Skills Utilized:

HTML: Used for creating the structure of the website.
SCSS: Employed for customizing the website's styling, providing better control over CSS styles.
React: Utilized to build a dynamic, single-page application with reusable components.
React Router DOM: Used for handling navigation and routing between different pages.
React Bootstrap: Employed to enhance the website's design and responsiveness using pre-built Bootstrap components.
React Framer Motion: Used for implementing smooth animations and transitions in the user interface.
Axios API: Employed to fetch movie data from a third-party API (e.g., The Movie Database API).
npm: Used to manage project dependencies and package installation.
Firebase Deploy: Utilized for deploying the website to Firebase hosting, making it accessible online.
